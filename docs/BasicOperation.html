<br>
<br>When you first run "JTides," it will appear with a default data window (Port Townsend, WA). To choose a different location for tide prediction, click the closed file folder icon at the left on the toolbar (<img src="../jtides/icons/Folder.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">) or use the menu item "File ... Open."
<br>
<br>This choice is called "Site Explorer." It shows a tree display, broken into categories and subcategories. You may choose to navigate the tree using your mouse, or you may wish to type a search string for a global search. <br>

<br>The tree has two main sections - tidal stations and current stations. Beneath these sections are countries, "states," and individual sites. Simply click folders to open them, and click sites to display them in the program. Click <a href="SiteExplorer.html">here</a> to read more about Site Explorer.

<br>
<br>By default, "JTides" shows a one-day chart of tide or current. Explore the display options on the toolbar -- you can show several days, or a clickable month (<img src="../jtides/icons/InitProject.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">), displayed as a color-coded chart where the colors represent different tidal heights at different times of the month. There is also a conventional monthly calendar display (<img src="../jtides/icons/Document.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">), suitable for printing. You can read more about these display options <a href="DisplayOptions.html">here.</a><P>

Once you have chosen and displayed a site, you may want to find nearby sites. Click the "Find Nearest Sites" toolbar button (<img src="../jtides/icons/World2.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">) to list those sites that are nearest to the displayed site. This option is more fully described <a href="NearestSites.html">here.</a><P>

There are more than 2,000 worldwide sites in the JTides default configuration (your installation presently has [totalSites] defined), and for most locations, predictions are available from 1970 to 2038.<p>

This is just an introduction to the many display features of JTides. Click one of the links below for more information.<P>
