To open the JTides Configuration/Database dialog, press the Configuration/Database toolbar button <img src="../jtides/icons/DocumentMag.png" width="20" height="20" align=center> or right-click on a tidal display and choose "Configuration/Data."<p>

The configuration values you choose are saved for you in a file named "JTides.ini", located on your system at <b>&nbsp;[basePath]/JTides.ini</b>, so you can customize your copy of JTides and your choices will persist.<p>

Most of the choices are self-explanatory, especially because they take place immediately -- so be sure to allow yourself a view of the main program with a chart on display when you make your choices.<p>

It is not so obvious what "Application Look and Feel" might refer to. Sun Inc., the creators of Java, have created a graphical user interface (GUI) called "Swing" that is able to change its appearance on the fly to meet the requirements of different platforms. This configuration option allows you to choose the overall appearance of JTides to suit your preference.<p>

When you make a choice, the main application changes its appearance immediately, but the configuration dialog stays the same. The dialog will take on the new appearance the next time it is activated.<p>

Read about the second dialog tab in the Configuration/Database dialog under the section <a href="ExportOptions.html">Data Export Options</a>.<p>
