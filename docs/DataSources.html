<br>
<br>If you have a professional interest in adding to or updating the "JTides" database files, you may want to  visit the "Xtide" site (<font color=#0000ff>http://www.flaterco.com/xtide</font>), because that is the primary source for the data files used in "JTides." The older, plain-text XTides data files are compatible with JTides' data format. If you add to or remove files from the data subdirectory (located in this machine at <b>&nbsp;[basePath]</b>), or edit any of the files, "JTides" will detect this on its next run and automatically regenerate its index file.
<br>
<br>If you have data files that you want to keep, but you do not want to use at the moment, simply change their suffix to something other than ".txt". On its next run, "JTides" will detect this change and regenerate its index, including any additional sites in its database.
<br>
<br>In general, any file in the above directory that has a ".txt" suffix and has the internal format of the data files delivered with "JTides," will be read and used successfully. If the file doesn't have the appropriate internal format, JTides will generate appropriate error messages.<p>
