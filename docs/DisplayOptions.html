<br>
<br>The basic JTides display is a one-day chart with a graphed tidal height, sunrise and sunset times listed and graphically displayed, and the current time's tidal height on display.
<br>
<br>You may read the tidal height at another time by simply clicking your mouse on the chart - the red time line will move with the mouse and a tidal prediction will be made. If you don't see a red line, change this option in the <a href="Configuration.html">configuration</a> options (click <img src="../jtides/icons/DocumentMag.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" align=center> on the toolbar).
<br>
<br>You may also display multi-day tidal predictions. Just click one of the toolbar's magnifying-glass symbols (<img src="../jtides/icons/Magnify.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" align=center>, <img src="../jtides/icons/MagnifyMinus.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" align=center>, or <img src="../jtides/icons/MagnifyPlus.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" align=center>) for this choice. When more than one day is on display, no sunrise or sunset times are shown.
<br>
<br>To see a 30/60 day chart, click the toolbar icon that looks like a piece of paper (<img src="../jtides/icons/InitProject.png" width="20" height="20" alt="" align=center>). This 30-day chart is handled differently. It shows 30 days of tidal predictions as colors - brown for low tide or ebb currents, moving to green, blue and aqua as the tide rises or the currents change to flood. Each row is a day, and the times of day are distributed horizontally as in the day charts. In this chart, click points of interest with the mouse to see the prediction.<p>

There are actually two versions of the color-coded chart, and each has two time durations. If your machine is relatively fast, press the palette button (<img src="../jtides/icons/Palette.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">) to see a smoothed version of the month chart. This version of the chart is easier to look at (some might say prettier), but it requires a great deal more computer power to generate.<p>

Also, for both these color charts, if you want to see 60 days' worth of data instead of 30, just press the same button again.

<br>These charts make a nice, color-coded monthly summary of the tides. And it is easy to pick dates and times of interest with the mouse to get predictions.
<br>
<br>Finally, you can display or print a conventionally formatted calendar chart of tides or currents. Just press the next button on the toolbar (<img src="../jtides/icons/Document.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">). This calendar is more for printing than viewing, so don't be surprised if it is hard to read on the display. It is easier to read when printed on paper.<p>

One more thing. Unlike most graphical programs, JTides automatically scales its graphic display. If you maximize a JTides chart and/or the main program frame, the chart will expand to fill the available display space.<p>
