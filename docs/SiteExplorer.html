To start Site Explorer, click the Site Explorer toolbar button <img src="../jtides/icons/Folder.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">, or right-click an open site display and choose "Site Explorer."<P>

The display is organized as a tree, with two main branches -- tide sites and current sites (each of which represents a reporting station). Beneath these categories are countries/regions, states/territories, and individual sites. Your configuration presently defines [totalSites] sites of all kinds.<p>

To open the tree, you can click the handles to the left of the file folder icons, or you can choose "Expand" to open the entire tree. This is actually not a terribly efficient way to look for a a paticular site, but it is fun to browse.<p>

To quickly locate a particular place by name, it is more efficient to enter a keyword and click "Find" (<img src="../jtides/icons/Frame.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">) or press Enter. The search algorithm accepts partial words and is not case sensitive. Once a particular site has been found, simply click the mouse cursor on the site to open a display of that site.<p>

You may want to locate more than one site that matches your entered search string. To do this, press "Find Next" (<img src="../jtides/icons/Frames.png" width="20" height="20" alt="">).<p>

It is also important for you to know that your site choices are remembered when you exit JTides, and are reloaded when you run JTides again. You can also redisplay a previously displayed site by choosing from the list at the bottom of the file menu.<p>

To switch from one open window to another, press Tab, or use the open window list at the bottom of the Windows menu item.<p>
